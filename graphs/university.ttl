    ns1:hasDescription "This course is designed to give students practical experience working with field-based community ecology. It involves one or two weeks of field work in a research station (mandatory sleepover), followed by weekly meetings during the fall term. Students learn about sampling methods, experimental design, and statistical tools with the aim of estimating and comparing patterns of biological diversity. Students design and implement their own short study in the field. In the weekly meetings, students process samples collected in the field, perform analysis, present their results in the form of oral presentation as well as written assignment. Students reside in a field station during the field-based portion of the course. They are expected to cover the cost of room and board, and other necessary fees. The location and cost of the field work may change from year to year. Interested students must contact the instructor to obtain detailed information." ;

on the fundamentals of interfacing. The students learn how to use
General Purpose Input Outputs (GPIOs) to connect various peripheral
devises to the microprocessor and write programs to control these
devices. Examples of peripheral devices are Light Emitted Diodes
(LEDs), switches, timer/counters, seven-segments, Liquid Crystal
Displays (LCDs) and sensors. They also learn how to configure serial

Choreography is the art of rendering a concept into the physical design of dance through movement and forms of notation. This course develops personal creativity and broadens the student’s physical and expressive potential into public performances. By organizing movement, space, and time into dances, students follow through the stages of originating ideas, developing themes, and rehearsing and performing choreographic creations. The course also explores the role that technology plays within both the choreographic and production processes.

Illuminating the politics – national, postcolonial, gendered and global – present in Irish theatre, this course shows that when theatre holds a mirror up to the Irish nation, a wider world is reflected back.

From the collectively devised works of Charabanc to Verbatim plays about the Northern Irish troubles, from activist theatre to street theatre, this course explores what happens when theatremakers step outside of conventional spaces and working methods to make art for our mediatized, technologized and globalized era.

    ns1:hasDescription """This seminar explores the central concepts and theories in feminist cultural studies, as they inform feminist, post-colonial, queer, and post-structuralist understandings of culture. The focus is on women as cultural producers and subjects in/of various cultural texts (e.g. cinema, visual arts, music, advertising, popular media, feminist writings). The discursive construction of gender, as it is inflected by class, race, sexuality, and location, is examined as well as the ways in which it is used, displayed, imagined and performed in contemporary culture. Students develop practical and analytical skills, posing questions of how particular cultural narratives function within social, political and economic contexts. Students are required to participate in and lead discussions of the readings and to create and/or critique cultural productions.
