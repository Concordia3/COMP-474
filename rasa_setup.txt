a few things to keep in mind before you train and test your rasa
    - make sure that you're in the bot directory
    - the default action endpoint is at http://localhost:5055/webhook
    - the default core endpoint (when you run rasa shell or rasa run) is at http://localhost:5005/
    - every time you make changes to your actions.py file, make sure to reset the action enpoint afterwards 

1. in actions/actions.py, define custom actions that you want rasa to do
1. in data/nlu.yaml, this file contains examples of user inputs that you want rasa to train on. each set of examples is associated with an intent (topic)
3. in data/stories.yaml, add:
- story: list courses
  steps:
  - intent: list_courses
  - action: action_list_courses
----> but replace story, intent and action as needed
4. in domain.yaml, make sure to update intents and actions (same as data/stories.yaml)
5. once everything is done, in the command line, do rasa train
6. then rasa run actions to turn on the action enpoint
7. then rasa shell to interact with your rasa
