It involves one or two weeks of field work in a research station (mandatory sleepover), followed by weekly meetings during the fall term. Students learn about sampling methods, experimental design, and statistical tools with the aim of estimating and comparing patterns of biological diversity. Students design and implement their own short study in the field. In the weekly meetings, students process samples collected in the field, perform analysis, present their results in the form of oral presentation as well as written assignment. Students reside in a field station during the field-based portion of the course. They are expected to cover the cost of room and board, and other necessary fees. The location and cost of the field work may change from year to year. Interested students must contact the instructor to obtain detailed information."

Lecture topics and case studies are selected to portray the nature of the strategic process and the dynamics of competition in a variety of contexts. Attention is also given to the issues of social responsibility, ethics, and personal values. In this context, the course also examines the connection between organizational strategy and the physical environment.

Instead, under the auspices of l'Association des Agences de Communication Créative (A2C), every year two Quebec inter-university competitions are organized and conducted. The Relève Communication was initiated in 1992 and the Relève Marketing in 1999. JMSB has entered teams of six students in both of these competitions since their inception. For both, participating university teams are given a day-long briefing in January by a company, not-for-profit organization or government agency and one or more of its communications agencies. The brief concludes with a mandate for which teams must create a complete communications or marketing plan for the client with a due date in late April. Their recommended plans are presented to the clients in their boardrooms or in their agency's pitch rooms. The judging panels include senior executives from the client (often its CEO), from the client's communications agencies and from A2C members. Throughout the academic term during which the competitions occur, students have the opportunity to apply the theories that they have learned so far in their BComm program to situations which are as close to 'real life' as possible in an academic setting.",Real-world project/assignment,Course-integrated,No website provided,Please see UGRD Calendar

Choreography is the art of rendering a concept into the physical design of dance through movement and forms of notation. This course develops personal creativity and broadens the student’s physical and expressive potential into public performances. By organizing movement, space, and time into dances, students follow through the stages of originating ideas, developing themes, and rehearsing and performing choreographic creations. The course also explores the role that technology plays within both the choreographic and production processes. Practical exercises provide students with a working knowledge in the use of video, sound manipulation, and stage lighting."

This studio course is an introduction to electronics as applied to artistic projects. It focuses on practical applications of basic electronic principles and techniques and the integration of electronic components and circuits in works of art. From basic electricity to motor control, from flashers and beepers to motion detectors, from analog circuits to digital technologies, it allows students to create artworks involving light, sound, movement, sensors, and interactivity.

This studio course investigates performance art as a form of social and artistic intervention that crosses between the visual and performing arts. Reflecting the long-standing and historical importance of performance practices in the visual arts, students focus on the production of projects that may reflect such issues as real-time, site-specific, interventionist actions, the interrelationship between installations and performances, and the interdisciplinary interface between performance and other practices found in the performing arts. This course also examines video performance and photography as media for generating performative gestures and as documentation tools."

Under the guidance of the professor, in dialogue with field supervisors, students conduct their field project that is based on their learning interests, helpful to a community and realistic to undertake. Facilitation techniques that generate reflection and skill-sharing are used to enable students to learn about and apply the steps of project management, including assessment, design, implementation, and evaluation. The student cohort is constituted as a community of practice to facilitate peer-to-peer mentorship as they experience challenges and successes in the field. Meta-teaching pedagogy is used to help students become aware and learn from the group processes at play, skills that are at the heart of CED practice.

Ce cours d'apprentissage expérientiel combine le travail sur un projet en DEC et le temps passé en classe, offrant aux étudiant·e·s la possibilité d'appliquer les connaissances et les compétences acquises lors des cours antérieurs et simultanés à une expérience concrète sur le terrain. Sous la supervision de l’enseignant·e, en dialogue avec les superviseur·e·s de terrain, les étudiant·e·s mènent leur projet de terrain qui est basé sur leurs intérêts d'apprentissage, utile à une communauté et réaliste à entreprendre. Des techniques d'animation qui suscitent la réflexion et le partage des compétences sont utilisées pour permettre aux étudiant·e·s d'apprendre et d'appliquer les étapes de la gestion de projet, y compris l'évaluation des besoins, la conception, la mise en oeuvre et le bilan. La cohorte est constituée comme une communauté de pratique pour faciliter le mentorat entre pair·e·s au fur et à mesure que les étudiant·e·s font l'expérience des défis et des réussites sur le terrain. La pédagogie du méta enseignement est utilisée pour aider les étudiant·e·s à prendre conscience des processus de groupe en jeu et à en tirer des enseignements, des compétences qui sont au coeur de la pratique du DÉC.

The focus is on women as cultural producers and subjects in/of various cultural texts (e.g. cinema, visual arts, music, advertising, popular media, feminist writings). The discursive construction of gender, as it is inflected by class, race, sexuality, and location, is examined as well as the ways in which it is used, displayed, imagined and performed in contemporary culture. Students develop practical and analytical skills, posing questions of how particular cultural narratives function within social, political and economic contexts. Students are required to participate in and lead discussions of the readings and to create and/or critique cultural productions.
